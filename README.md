# Titration-uncertainty-calculator

The project aims to calculate the uncertainty of instruments using a python code. It returns the titration concentration value and the corresponsing uncertainty. 

The aim of the project is to create a simple GUI in whicch users can input titration data and recieve the corresponding values, easily rather than manually calculate the absolute and relative uncertainties for each aspect of the experiment

To get started with the project just use the source code? make requests to add more functionalities to the simple calculator and suggest how the GUI can be made or made better

I directly make changes and contribute to the project
